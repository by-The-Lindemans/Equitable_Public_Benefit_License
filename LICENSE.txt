Public Benefit Equity License (PBE-L) v0.1rc004

Preamble
This license is for software that advances broad public benefit. It permits use by qualifying individuals and benevolent organizations that operate within simple, verifiable limits; it blocks capture by for-profit and ultra-wealthy actors. Compliance is kept simple by filing a single annual Attestation by email.

1. Definitions

1.1 Software means the licensed code, models, data files, documentation, and build or configuration files included in this repository.

1.2 Outputs means the results produced by running the Software.

1.3 Artifacts means trained weights, datasets, prompts, parameter sets, or other configuration elements that materially enable reproduction of the Software’s performance without access to the Software itself.

1.4 Individual means a natural person using the Software for their own purposes.

1.5 Organization means any legal entity other than a natural person, including a nonprofit, cooperative, foundation, association, or company, and any group operating as a joint venture or under common control.

1.6 Benevolent Organization means an Organization that is not for-profit; has a primary public benefit mission stated in its charter or bylaws; applies benefits from the Software equitably among employees if it uses the Software to fund or inform pay; and is not subject to Control by Outside Capital.

1.7 Control and Outside Capital. Control means the practical ability to direct an Organization’s policies or use of the Software, whether through equity, debt, contracts, or board authority. Outside Capital means investors, lenders, or principals whose primary objective is financial return rather than the Organization’s public benefit mission.

1.8 Transparency Year means the Organization’s fiscal year; for Individuals, the calendar year.

1.9 Net Worth Cap means the top ten percent household net worth threshold as reported by the Licensee’s national statistics office or by the U.S. Survey of Consumer Finances.

1.10 Income Cap means the lower of the top ten percent household income threshold and the SEC accredited investor household income threshold. Use current published figures; update when sources update.

1.11 FTE Headcount means the average of paid hours over the prior 90 days divided by 40; include employees and contractors performing bona fide services.

1.12 Org Caps. Org Net Assets Cap equals 2 x FTE Headcount x Net Worth Cap. Org Gross Receipts Cap equals 2 x FTE Headcount x Income Cap.

1.13 Attestation means the annual compliance statement completed on the PBE-L template for Organizations or Individuals and filed as described in Section 6.

1.14 Attestation Inbox means the submission email address for Attestations: attest@lndmn.com.

1.15 Venue means Oregon, USA; Multnomah County courts.

1.16 Compliance Contact means an email address the Licensee may include in the Attestation to receive compliance questions.

2. Grant

2.1 License Grant. Subject to Section 3 and the other terms of this license, the Licensor grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, copy, modify, and distribute the Software and Outputs for purposes consistent with this license.

2.2 No Trademark. This license does not grant rights in names, logos, or trademarks except as allowed in Section 11.

3. Eligibility and Use Limits

3.1 Allowed Individuals. An Individual may use the Software only if the Individual’s household wealth and income are at or below the Net Worth Cap and Income Cap.

3.2 Allowed Organizations. An Organization may use the Software only if it is a Benevolent Organization and, measured for the Transparency Year, both its net assets and gross receipts are at or below the Org Caps.

3.3 Prohibited Users. For-profit entities; investment funds; proprietary trading firms; high-frequency or market-making firms; Organizations under Control by Outside Capital; and any Individual or Organization above the applicable Caps are prohibited users.

3.4 No Brokerage of Prohibited Use. You must not provide the Software, Outputs, or Artifacts to a prohibited user; you must not operate the Software as a service for a prohibited user; and you must not design around these conditions by interposing agents, shells, or contractors.

3.5 Research Sharing. You may publish methods and aggregate statistics. You must not publish Artifacts or parameter sets that would reasonably enable a prohibited user to reproduce the Software’s performance.

4. Employment and Pay

4.1 Payroll Allowed. Organizations may use the Software to fund or inform payroll and benefits for bona fide services.

4.2 Equitable Application. If the Software funds or informs pay, the Organization must apply the benefits of the Software equitably among employees. The Organization must disclose executive pay in bands no wider than 25,000 in its transparency materials or in linked filings referenced in the Attestation.

5. Consolidation and Anti-Fragmentation

5.1 Consolidation. If an Organization operates a group of related entities under common control, it must consolidate those entities for purposes of FTE Headcount, Caps, and transparency.

5.2 Anti-avoidance. Arrangements that exist primarily to evade Caps or reporting requirements violate this license.

6. Transparency and Attestation

6.1 Single filing channel. File the Attestation each Transparency Year by email to the Attestation Inbox at attest@lndmn.com. Keep a copy of the filed Attestation and any attachments.

6.2 What to file. The Attestation must include: (a) the Transparency Year; (b) for Organizations, the FTE window, computed FTE Headcount, and the Org Caps calculations; (c) either the required transparency content inline or stable links to existing public filings or pages that contain it; and (d) if using the small-organization safe harbor, the required statement and counts. A Compliance Contact email may be included.

6.3 Deadline. File by the earlier of 120 days after fiscal year end or the deadline that applies to the Licensee’s largest mandatory annual public filing in its home jurisdiction.

6.4 Records. Preserve the filed Attestation and supporting materials for seven years and provide them on good-faith request under Section 7.

6.5 Privacy. Do not disclose personal financial account numbers or sensitive personal data. Redactions are allowed so long as figures and sources remain verifiable.

7. Verification

7.1 Good-faith requests. Licensor or any user with a good-faith concern may request that you verify eligibility or reporting. You must respond within 30 days with a brief statement and links or redacted documents sufficient to confirm compliance.

8. Termination and Cure

8.1 Automatic termination. This license terminates automatically if you breach Section 3 or 6.

8.2 Cure period. If the breach is curable, the license reinstates automatically on the thirty-first day after you fully cure and file an updated Attestation.

8.3 No use after termination. After termination you must stop using the Software, Outputs, and Artifacts and must not rediscover or reacquire access through intermediaries.

9. Warranty and Liability

9.1 Disclaimer. The Software is provided “as is” without warranties or conditions of any kind.

9.2 Limitation. To the extent allowed by law, Licensor is not liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages; and Licensor’s total liability is capped at one hundred dollars.

10. Patents

10.1 Patent grant. If you comply with this license, Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license to make, use, and distribute the Software that Licensor could license to you.

10.2 Patent retaliation. If you make any claim that the Software infringes a patent, your license under this license ends immediately.

11. Marks and Badge

11.1 Marks. “Public Benefit Equity License” and “PBE-L” are marks of the Licensor. Use them only to refer to the unmodified license.

11.2 License badge. Repositories may display a “License: PBE-L” badge that links to the canonical LICENSE text. Do not display “compliant” badges; compliance is shown by filing a current Attestation to the Attestation Inbox.

12. Attribution

12.1 Preserve notices. Keep copyright notices and this license text in copies of the Software and significant portions.

13. Versioning and Changes

13.1 Version. This license is versioned. If Licensor publishes a new version, you may continue under this version or adopt the new one.
