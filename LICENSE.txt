Public Benefit Equity License (PBE-L) v0.1rc007

Preamble
This license is for software that advances broad public benefit. It permits use by qualifying individuals and benevolent organizations that operate within simple, verifiable limits; it blocks capture by for-profit and ultra-wealthy actors. Compliance is kept simple by filing a single annual Attestation by email.

1. Definitions

1.1 Software means the licensed code, models, data files, documentation, and build or configuration files included in this repository.

1.2 Outputs means the results produced by running the Software.

1.3 Artifacts means trained weights, datasets, prompts, parameter sets, or other configuration elements that materially enable reproduction of the Software’s performance without access to the Software itself.

1.4 Individual means a natural person using the Software for their own purposes.

1.5 Organization means any legal entity other than a natural person, including a nonprofit, cooperative, foundation, association, or company, and any group operating as a joint venture or under common control.

1.6 Benevolent Organization means an Organization that is not for-profit; has a primary public benefit mission stated in its charter or bylaws; applies benefits from the Software equitably among employees if it uses the Software to fund or inform pay; and is not subject to Control by Outside Capital.

1.7 Control and Outside Capital. Control means, directly or indirectly, (a) ownership of more than 50 percent of voting interests; or (b) contractual or other practical ability to direct management and policies. Entities under common Control are under common control. Outside Capital means any investor, lender, private owner, or similar capital provider whose primary objective is financial return ahead of the Organization’s public-benefit mission, including where return-seeking rights or covenants create practical ability to direct the Organization’s use of the Software.

1.8 Transparency Year means the Organization’s fiscal year; for Individuals, the calendar year.

1.9 Household means all persons who share a primary residence and pool a majority of living expenses.

1.10 Measurement Date means the last day of the Transparency Year.

1.11 Net Worth Cap means the top ten percent household net worth threshold published for the Licensee’s country of residence, measured as of the Measurement Date. If multiple official sources exist, use in order: (i) the national statistics office; (ii) the most recent U.S. Survey of Consumer Finances, adjusted by purchasing power parity (PPP) to the Licensee’s country; (iii) if neither is available, the OECD wealth distribution dataset.

1.12 Income Cap means the lower of (i) the top ten percent household income threshold and (ii) the SEC accredited investor household income threshold (household), each as of the Measurement Date. If the Licensee is outside the U.S., treat (ii) as a fixed U.S. dollar value and convert per Section 1.14.

1.13 FTE Headcount means the average number of full-time-equivalent workers over the 13 weeks (91 days) ending on the Measurement Date. Compute it as: FTE Headcount = total paid hours during that 13-week period ÷ 520. Include employees and contractors performing bona fide services (including paid time off); exclude unpaid volunteers. Round to the nearest whole number using half-up.

1.14 Currency. All thresholds and bands are expressed in U.S. dollars unless the Attestation states a local currency. If local currency is used, convert U.S. dollar thresholds at the daily WM/Refinitiv 16:00 London rate on the Measurement Date and state the rate used.

1.15 Org Caps. Org Net Assets Cap equals 2 × FTE Headcount × Net Worth Cap. Org Gross Receipts Cap equals 2 × FTE Headcount × Income Cap. For Organizations, net assets and gross receipts are measured under the Organization’s primary financial reporting basis for that year (for example, U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or the local nonprofit standard), applying the same basis consistently year over year.

1.16 Attestation means the annual compliance statement completed on the PBE-L template for Organizations or Individuals and filed as described in Section 6.

1.17 Attestation Inbox means the submission email address for Attestations: attest@lndmn.com.

1.18 Venue means Oregon, USA; Multnomah County courts.

1.19 Compliance Contact means an email address the Licensee may include in the Attestation to receive compliance questions.

2. Grant

2.2 No Trademark. This license does not grant rights in names, logos, or trademarks except as allowed in Section 11.

3. Eligibility and Use Limits

3.1 Allowed Individuals. An Individual may use the Software only if the Individual’s Household wealth and income are at or below the Net Worth Cap and Income Cap.

3.2 Allowed Organizations. An Organization may use the Software only if it is a Benevolent Organization and, measured for the Transparency Year, both its net assets and gross receipts are at or below the Org Caps.

3.3 Prohibited Users. For-profit entities; investment funds; proprietary trading firms; high-frequency or market-making firms; Organizations under Control by Outside Capital; and any Individual or Organization above the applicable Caps are prohibited users.

3.4 No Brokerage of Prohibited Use. You must not provide the Software, Outputs, or Artifacts to a prohibited user; you must not operate the Software as a service for a prohibited user; and you must not design around these conditions by interposing agents, shells, or contractors.

3.5 Research Sharing. You may publish methods and aggregate statistics. You must not publish Artifacts or parameter sets that would reasonably enable a prohibited user to reproduce the Software’s performance.

4. Employment and Pay

4.1 Payroll Allowed. Organizations may use the Software to fund or inform payroll and benefits for bona fide services.

4.2 Equitable Application. If the Software funds or informs pay, the Organization must apply the benefits of the Software equitably among employees. The Organization must disclose executive pay in bands no wider than 25,000 (state the currency and year) in its transparency materials or in linked filings referenced in the Attestation. Executive means any officer or employee whose total compensation is among the five highest for the Transparency Year, plus the principal executive officer, whether or not among the five highest.

5. Consolidation and Anti-Fragmentation

5.1 Consolidation. If an Organization operates a group of related entities under common control, it must consolidate those entities for purposes of FTE Headcount, Caps, and transparency.

5.2 Anti-avoidance. Arrangements that exist primarily to evade Caps or reporting requirements violate this license.

6. Transparency and Attestation

6.1 Single filing channel. File the Attestation each Transparency Year by email to the Attestation Inbox at attest@lndmn.com. Keep a copy of the filed Attestation and any attachments.

6.1.1 Submission and receipt. Attestations must be sent to attest@lndmn.com as PDF or Markdown attachments. Attachments should not exceed twenty megabytes in total; if larger, provide a link to a publicly readable copy.

6.6 Who files. The duty to file an Attestation rests on each Licensee that uses the Software.

Including the license, the badge, and the attestation templates satisfies their distribution duties under this license.

7. Verification

7.1 Good-faith requests. Licensor, or a third party designated by Licensor, may request verification no more than once per Transparency Year absent credible evidence of non-compliance.
