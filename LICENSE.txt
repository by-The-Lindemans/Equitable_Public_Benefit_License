Equitable Public Benefit License (EPBL) v0.3.0-rc3

Preamble
This license is for software that advances broad public benefit. It permits use by qualifying individuals and benevolent organizations that operate within simple, verifiable limits; it blocks capture by for-profit and ultra-wealthy actors. Compliance is kept simple by filing a single annual Attestation by email.

1. Definitions

1.1 Software means the licensed code, models, data files, documentation, and build or configuration files included in this repository.

1.2 Outputs means the results produced by running the Software.

1.3 Artifacts means trained weights, datasets, prompts, parameter sets, or other configuration elements that materially enable reproduction of the Software‚Äôs performance without access to the Software itself.

1.4 Individual means a natural person using the Software for their own purposes.

1.5 Organization means any legal entity other than a natural person, including a nonprofit, cooperative, foundation, association, or company, and any group operating as a joint venture or under common control.

1.6 Benevolent Organization means an Organization that is not for-profit; has a primary public benefit mission stated in its charter or bylaws; applies benefits from the Software equitably among employees if it uses the Software to fund or inform pay; and is not subject to Control by Outside Capital.

1.7 Control and Outside Capital. Control means, directly or indirectly, (a) ownership of more than 50 percent of voting interests; or (b) contractual or other practical ability to direct management and policies. Outside Capital means any investor, lender, private owner, or similar capital provider whose primary objective is financial return ahead of the Organization‚Äôs public-benefit mission, including where return-seeking rights or covenants create practical ability to direct the Organization‚Äôs use of the Software.

1.8 Transparency Year means the Organization‚Äôs fiscal year; for Individuals, the calendar year.

1.9 Household means all persons who share a primary residence and pool a majority of living expenses.

1.10 Measurement Date means the last day of the Transparency Year.

1.11 Net Worth Cap means:
  (a) if the Licensee‚Äôs primary jurisdiction (for Individuals, residence; for Organizations, country of incorporation or primary operations stated in the Attestation) is the United States, the U.S. Default Net Worth Cap published for this license version in Annex A; or
  (b) otherwise, for Individuals, the household net worth threshold at the Half-Wealth Percentile (HWP) for the Licensee‚Äôs country of residence; and for Organizations, the threshold for the country of incorporation or, if different, the country of primary operations stated in the Attestation; in each case measured as of the Measurement Date. If multiple official sources exist, use in order: (i) the national statistics office; (ii) the most recent U.S. Survey of Consumer Finances, adjusted by purchasing power parity (PPP) to the Licensee‚Äôs country; (iii) if neither is available, the OECD wealth distribution dataset. If an exact percentile threshold is not published, compute it by linear interpolation between the nearest available percentiles.

1.12 FTE Headcount means the average number of full-time-equivalent workers over the 13 weeks (91 days) ending on the Measurement Date. Compute it as: FTE Headcount = total paid hours during that 13-week period √∑ 520. Include employees and contractors performing bona fide services, including paid time off; exclude unpaid volunteers. Round to the nearest whole number using half-up.

1.13 Currency. All thresholds and bands are expressed in U.S. dollars unless the Attestation states a local currency. If local currency is used, convert U.S. dollar thresholds at the daily WM/Refinitiv 16:00 London rate on the Measurement Date and state the rate used.

1.14 Org Caps. Org Net Assets Cap equals 2 √ó FTE Headcount √ó the Net Worth Cap. Org Gross Receipts Cap equals 0.33 √ó FTE Headcount √ó the Net Worth Cap. For Organizations, net assets and gross receipts are measured under the Organization‚Äôs primary financial reporting basis for that year (for example, U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or the local nonprofit standard), applying the same basis consistently year over year.

1.15 Attestation means the annual compliance statement completed on the EPBL template for Organizations or Individuals and filed as described in Section 6.

1.16 Attestation Inbox means the submission email address for Attestations: attest@lndmn.com.

1.18 Compliance Contact means an email address the Licensee may include in the Attestation to receive compliance questions.

1.19 Public Reporting Channel means the public issue form titled ‚ÄúReport a license violation‚Äù in the canonical EPBL repository on GitHub, or any successor page the Licensor identifies in that repository.

1.20 Business Day means any day other than Saturday, Sunday, or a U.S. federal legal holiday in California.

1.21 Executive means any officer or employee whose total compensation is among the five highest for the Transparency Year, plus the principal executive officer, whether or not among the five highest.

1.22 Prohibited User means any person or entity described in Section 3.3 (including any person or entity above the applicable Caps).

1.23 Governing Law means the law of the State of California, without regard to conflict-of-laws rules.

1.24 Marks means the names ‚ÄúEquitable Public Benefit License‚Äù and ‚ÄúEPBL‚Äù.

1.25 Half-Wealth Percentile (HWP) means the smallest household percentile ùëù such that households at or below ùëù hold at least fifty percent of aggregate household net worth in the Licensee‚Äôs country for the Transparency Year that includes the Measurement Date.

2. Grant

2.1 License Grant. Subject to Section 3 and the other terms of this license, the Licensor grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, copy, modify, and distribute the Software and Outputs for purposes consistent with this license.

2.2 No Trademark. This license does not grant rights in names, logos, or trademarks except as allowed in Section 11.

2.3 Acceptance. By exercising any rights granted by this license (including use, copying, modification, or distribution), you accept these terms.

3. Eligibility and Use Limits

3.1 Allowed Individuals. An Individual may use the Software only if the Individual‚Äôs Household wealth is at or below the Net Worth Cap.

3.2 Allowed Organizations. An Organization may use the Software only if it is a Benevolent Organization and, measured for the Transparency Year, both its net assets and gross receipts are at or below the Org Caps. For the avoidance of doubt, an Organization‚Äôs eligibility does not require its employees or contractors to meet any individual cap under this license.

3.3 Prohibited Users. For-profit entities; investment funds; proprietary trading firms; high-frequency or market-making firms; Organizations under Control by Outside Capital; and any Individual or Organization above the applicable Caps are Prohibited Users.

3.4 No Brokerage of Prohibited Use. You must not provide the Software, Outputs, or Artifacts to a Prohibited User; you must not operate the Software as a service for a Prohibited User; and you must not design around these conditions by interposing agents, shells, or contractors.

3.5 Research Sharing. You may publish methods and aggregate statistics. You must not publish Artifacts or parameter sets that would reasonably enable a prohibited user to reproduce the Software‚Äôs performance. You must not publish Outputs that, in form or substance, function as Artifacts.

3.6 Export controls and sanctions. You must comply with applicable export, re-export, and sanctions laws. You must not use or provide the Software, Outputs, or Artifacts to any person or entity (or for any end-use) that is prohibited under U.S. sanctions or export control laws, including persons on OFAC‚Äôs Specially Designated Nationals or other blocked lists.

4. Employment and Pay

4.1 Payroll Allowed. Organizations may use the Software to fund or inform payroll and benefits for bona fide services.

4.2 Equitable Application. If the Software funds or informs pay, the Organization must apply the benefits of the Software equitably among employees. The Organization must disclose Executive compensation in bands no wider than 25,000 (state the currency and year) in its transparency materials or in linked filings referenced in the Attestation. An Organization may evidence equitable application through equal-dollar distributions, banded stipends, or capped percent-of-base methods; disclose the method in the Attestation.

5. Consolidation and Anti-Fragmentation

5.1 Consolidation. If an Organization operates a group of related entities under common control, it must consolidate those entities for purposes of FTE Headcount, Caps, and transparency.

5.2 Anti-avoidance. Arrangements that exist primarily to evade Caps or reporting requirements violate this license.

6. Transparency and Attestation

6.1 Single filing channel. File the Attestation each Transparency Year by email to the Attestation Inbox at attest@lndmn.com. Keep a copy of the filed Attestation and any attachments.

6.1.1 Submission and receipt. Attestations must be sent to attest@lndmn.com as PDF or Markdown attachments. Attachments should not exceed twenty megabytes in total; if larger, provide a link to a publicly readable copy. An Attestation is deemed received on the earlier of (a) Licensor‚Äôs email acknowledgment, or (b) two Business Days measured in Pacific Time in California after a message without a bounce is sent, as shown by the Licensee‚Äôs SMTP server logs. Licensees must retain evidence of sending and any acknowledgment.

6.2 What to file. The Attestation must include:
  (a) the Transparency Year and the Measurement Date;
  (b) the primary jurisdiction and whether Annex A applies. If Annex A applies, cite ‚ÄúU.S. Default Net Worth Cap (this version)‚Äù; no external source is required. If Annex A does not apply, state the Net Worth Cap figure used, its source, and publication date; and
  (c) for Organizations, the FTE window and computed FTE Headcount (Section 1.13), the Org Caps calculations using the Net Worth Cap, and either the required transparency content inline or stable links to existing public filings or pages that contain it; for Individuals, a statement that Household net worth is at or below the Net Worth Cap.
A Compliance Contact email may be included. An Attestation may be signed electronically and is valid if signed by an authorized officer or by the Individual.

6.3 Reporting Deadline. File by the earlier of 120 days after fiscal year end or the deadline that applies to the Licensee‚Äôs largest mandatory annual public filing in its home jurisdiction. If the Reporting Deadline falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the deadline is the next Business Day. Deadlines are measured in Pacific Time in California.

6.4 Records. Preserve the filed Attestation and supporting materials for seven years and provide them on good-faith request under Section 7. Evidence of timely filing includes any of: Licensor‚Äôs acknowledgment; outbound server logs showing successful delivery without bounce; or a timestamped submission receipt if provided by Licensor.

6.5 Privacy. Do not disclose personal financial account numbers or sensitive personal data. Redactions are allowed so long as figures and sources remain verifiable.

6.6 Who files. The duty to file an Attestation rests on each Licensee that uses the Software. Repository maintainers, hosting providers, and contributors are not required to collect, forward, or store Attestations. Including the license, the badge, and the attestation templates satisfies their distribution duties under this license.

6.7 Public Reporting Channel. Anyone may submit alleged violations or misuse through the Public Reporting Channel. Submissions there are public by default. Do not include account numbers, sensitive personal data, or confidential business information in a public submission.

6.8 Public reports are not Attestations or legal notice. A submission to the Public Reporting Channel does not satisfy any filing duty under this license and is not legal notice to any party. Licensees must file Attestations by email to the Attestation Inbox. Formal notices or verification requests under Section 7.1 must be sent privately.

6.9 Updating contact points. Licensor may change the Attestation Inbox or the Public Reporting Channel by publishing the new address or link in the canonical EPBL repository. The change is effective on publication.

7. Verification

7.1 Good-faith requests. Licensor, or a third party designated by Licensor, may request verification no more than once per Transparency Year absent credible evidence of non-compliance. Requests must identify the provision at issue and the Transparency Year and must be sent privately. Licensee must respond within 30 days with a brief statement and links or redacted documents sufficient to confirm compliance.

7.2 Use and confidentiality of verification materials. Materials you provide under Section 7.1 may be used solely to verify compliance under this license. Licensor and any designee must take reasonable steps to protect non-public information in those materials and may disclose them only to courts, regulators, or advisors as reasonably necessary for enforcement.

8. Termination and Cure

8.1 Automatic termination. This license terminates automatically if you breach Section 3 or 6.

8.2 Cure period. If the breach is curable, the license reinstates automatically on the thirty-first day after you fully cure and file an updated Attestation.

8.3 No use after termination. After termination you must stop using the Software, Outputs, and Artifacts and must not rediscover or reacquire access through intermediaries.

9. Warranty and Liability

9.1 Disclaimer. The Software is provided "as is" without warranties or conditions of any kind.

9.2 Limitation. To the extent allowed by law, Licensor is not liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages; and Licensor‚Äôs total liability is capped at one hundred dollars.

10. Patents

10.1 Patent grant. If you comply with this license, Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license to make, use, and distribute the Software that Licensor could license to you.

10.2 Patent retaliation. If you make any claim that the Software infringes a patent, your license under this license ends immediately.

11. Marks and Badge

11.1 Marks. The Marks are marks of the Licensor. Use them only to refer to the unmodified license.

11.2 License badge. Repositories may display a License: EPBL badge that links to the canonical LICENSE text.

12. Attribution and Distribution

12.1 Preserve notices and templates. Keep copyright notices and this license text in copies of the Software and significant portions. When distributing with source, include the attestation/ templates directory unmodified or provide a link to the canonical templates.

13.2 No side agreements. Terms outside this license do not change the permissions and conditions in this license.

14. Boilerplate

14.1 Severability and reformation. If any provision (or its application) is invalid or unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect to the maximum extent permitted. The invalid or unenforceable provision will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted and reformed as needed to be enforceable (blue-penciled).

14.2 No waiver. A failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver of future enforcement.

14.3 Entire agreement. This license is the entire agreement on its subject matter.

14.4 Permission to use this license text. You may copy and distribute this license text; you may apply it, unmodified, to your own software and repositories. If you change the terms, do not call the result EPBL and do not use the EPBL marks except as permitted in Section 11.

14.5 Survival. Sections 5, 6.4, 6.5, 7, 8, 9, 10.2, 11, 12, and 14 survive termination.

14.6 Attorneys‚Äô fees. In any action to enforce this license, the prevailing party is entitled to reasonable attorneys‚Äô fees and costs in addition to any fee awards available under applicable law.

14.7 Equitable relief and non-exclusive forum. The parties acknowledge that breaches of Sections 3, 4, 5, or 6 may cause irreparable harm. Licensor may seek temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief and specific performance in any court of competent jurisdiction, without posting bond, while the merits otherwise proceed in the Venue defined in Section 1.18.

14.8 Forum selection and consent. Each party consents to personal jurisdiction in the courts defined in Section 1.18; waives objections based on inconvenience; and agrees that venue there is proper.

14.9 Service. Each party consents to service of process by email and courier.

14.11 Governing language. If this license is translated, the English version controls.

14.12 No third-party beneficiaries. This license creates no third-party beneficiary rights.
