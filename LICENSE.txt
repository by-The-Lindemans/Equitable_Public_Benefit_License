3. License Grant
Subject to the conditions and restrictions below, the Licensor grants You a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to Use the Software. No trademark rights are granted.

4. Who May Use
4.1 Permitted Individual Users. A Permitted Individual User may Use the Software, including for Financial Gain, for that person’s own accounts. A Permitted Individual User may not Use the Software for any account, pool, project, or vehicle owned by another person or entity, whether by power of attorney, service agreement, or similar arrangement.

4.2 Benevolent Organizations. A Benevolent Organization may Use the Software, including for Financial Gain or other Material Benefit, solely for Mission-Related Purposes, provided that on each Measurement Date it remains below both Org Caps. Eligibility under this Section requires timely publication of the Transparency Report under Section 5.6. A Benevolent Organization may provide access to the Software as a service to its members or beneficiaries only if each recipient is a natural person or a Benevolent Organization, not a for-profit entity, and accepts this license. The Organization may compensate its Employees and Contractors for Bona Fide Services in any lawful form of compensation, including salary, wages, customary bonuses, and benefits.

4.3 Everyone else is prohibited. No Prohibited Person or Prohibited Entity may Use the Software, nor may anyone Use the Software for the benefit of a Prohibited Person or Prohibited Entity. For the avoidance of doubt, payroll and benefits paid to Employees and Contractors do not by themselves constitute Use for the benefit of a Prohibited Person. Distributions to investors, outside capital providers, or any person who is not an Employee or Contractor remain prohibited.

5. Additional Use Conditions
5.1 No service bureau for others. You must not provide the Software or its Outputs or Artifacts as a service to any third party unless that third party is eligible under Section 4 and accepts this license.

5.2 No circumvention. You must not split, proxy, or structure any Use to evade the eligibility limits in this license.

5.3 Outputs. You may keep and use Outputs or Artifacts You lawfully generate. You must not sell, license, or transfer Outputs or Artifacts to any Prohibited Person or Prohibited Entity. Payments of compensation or benefits to Employees or Contractors that are not themselves a sale or license of Outputs or Artifacts are not transfers for purposes of this Section.

5.4 Compensation structure. A Benevolent Organization may compensate Employees and Contractors in any lawful form of compensation, including salary, wages, customary bonuses, and benefits. Compensation must be paid from Organization accounts; must not grant any right or claim to Organization equity or assets; and must not be assigned, sold, or pledged to any third party. Using a Neutral Infrastructure Provider does not create a Prohibited Benefit. Any payment that routes Proceeds of Use or Organization funds to any investor, outside capital provider, or other third party is a Prohibited Benefit.

5.5 Equitable application of benefits. If a Benevolent Organization Uses the Software to inform or fund payroll, bonuses, or benefits, including where Material Benefit is cost savings or efficiency gains, it must apply the benefits of the Software with Equitable Application. Eligibility criteria must be role-related, objective, and non-discriminatory. The Organization must document the Compensation Plan and criteria and make them available to the Licensor on request under Section 10.

5.6 Financial transparency; publication required. A Benevolent Organization may Use the Software only if it publishes a Transparency Report at a Public Location by each Reporting Deadline and keeps the most recent seven years of Transparency Reports publicly available.
(a) Contents. Each Transparency Report must include, for the Fiscal Year covered:
  (1) the Organization’s total Net Assets and total Gross Receipts, stated in the same currency used for its financial statements, and the values used to test the Org Caps under this license;
  (2) the Organization’s FTE Headcount calculation under this license, including the lookback window dates and the total paid hours used in the calculation;
  (3) a statement that all Use of the Software was for Mission-Related Purposes and that no distributions were made to investors or outside capital providers;
  (4) a description of the Compensation Plan then in effect and the objective criteria used to apply benefits funded by or materially informed by Use of the Software;
  (5) Equitable Application metrics: the number of Employees eligible for variable compensation programs funded by or materially informed by Use of the Software, including where Material Benefit is cost savings or efficiency gains; the number who received payments under those programs; and a summary by role family showing eligibility criteria;
  (6) compensation bands for Executives stated as total annual compensation, with the count of Executives in each band. Bands must be contiguous, non-overlapping, of equal width within the report, and no wider than the greater of USD 50,000 or 15 percent of the band midpoint (or equivalent in local currency). Show the lower and upper bound of each band. If the spread between the lowest and highest Executive total compensation in the Fiscal Year exceeds the chosen band width, at least ceil(spread ÷ band width) bands must be reported;
  (7) any audited financial statements or, if none exist, year-end statements of activities and financial position; and
  (8) the Public Location URL where prior Transparency Reports are archived.
(b) Format. Items (1), (2), (5), and (6) must be provided in an Open Format. Other items may be provided in Open Format or PDF.
(c) Privacy and safety. A Transparency Report must not disclose personal identifying information of Employees or beneficiaries. Names of individuals need not be disclosed. Payments to entities must disclose the legal name of the entity.
(d) Notice. The Organization must include the Public Location URL for its Transparency Report in its annual attestation under Section 7 and must notify the Licensor if the URL changes.
(e) Legal conflicts. If public disclosure of specific line items is prohibited by applicable law, the Organization must publish all non-prohibited items and identify the withheld items and the law that prohibits disclosure. Items withheld by law remain subject to private verification under Section 10. If applicable law prohibits publication of all items required by this Section, the Organization is not eligible to Use the Software.
(f) Small-organization safe harbor. If, on the Reporting Deadline, the Organization has FTE Headcount of five or fewer and both its Net Assets and its Gross Receipts are less than twenty five percent of the applicable Org Caps, it may satisfy this Section by publishing items (1) through (4) and a brief statement of how Equitable Application was applied during the year. Item (6) is not required unless there are two or more Executives.
(g) Existing filings shortcut. An Organization that already publishes any of the following may satisfy this Section by publishing a short supplement in Open Format that provides the items not present in the filing: the FTE Headcount calculation, the Org Caps test, the Equitable Application metrics, and the Executive compensation bands required by item (6). Qualifying filings include a U.S. IRS Form 990 with schedules, a U.K. Charity Commission annual return, a Canada CRA T3010, an Australia ACNC AIS, a New Zealand Charities Services annual return, or audited financial statements published under applicable law. This list is illustrative, not exhaustive.
(h) Donor concentration screen. The Transparency Report must disclose the percentage of Gross Receipts coming from the single largest funding source during the Fiscal Year, rounded to the nearest five percent, and must state yes or no whether any funding source required approval rights over Use of the Software or its Outputs or Artifacts. If the largest source exceeded fifty percent and had such approval rights, the Organization is not eligible under this license.

5.7 Recordkeeping. A Benevolent Organization must maintain books and records sufficient to determine compliance with the Org Caps and Sections 5.4 and 5.5 for at least four years after each Measurement Date. On written request under Section 10, the Organization must provide records reasonably necessary to verify compliance.

5.8 Reasonable access controls. If an Organization provides access to the Software or its Outputs or Artifacts to members or beneficiaries, it must maintain reasonable technical and contractual measures to ensure recipients are either Permitted Individual Users or Benevolent Organizations. Examples include an annual click-through eligibility attestation; role-based access for accounts; and rate-limits that prevent bulk export of Outputs or Artifacts.

5.9 No replication or enablement for Prohibited parties. You must not publicly post or otherwise provide Outputs or Artifacts, implementation services, or systematic “playbooks” derived primarily from the Software that enable a Prohibited Person or Prohibited Entity to substantially reproduce the Software’s functionality or to systematically apply its Outputs or Artifacts. Publishing academic research, aggregate performance statistics, benchmarks, or high-level methodological discussion without actionable parameters or proprietary artifacts is not a violation of this Section.

5.10 Consolidation and measurement. For Org Caps and Transparency Report tests, a Common Control Group must report on a combined basis using consolidated Net Assets, Gross Receipts, and FTE Headcount. Internal transfers within the group are eliminated on consolidation. For Org Caps, Net Assets are measured as the arithmetic mean of month-end Net Assets over the Fiscal Year; Gross Receipts are measured for the full Fiscal Year. Temporary transfers within sixty days before or after a Measurement Date that reverse within that period are disregarded.

5.11 Public compliance badge. An Organization may display a link to its Transparency Report labeled “PBE-L compliant” at the Public Location. Displaying the badge creates no additional obligations and serves only to indicate where reports can be found.

6. Redistribution and Modification
6.1 Redistribution. You may redistribute the Software, with or without modifications, only under this license. You must include a copy of this license and a notice that identifies the Licensor and any copyright holders.
6.2 Modifications. If You modify the Software and distribute Your modifications, You must clearly mark changes and license the whole of Your modified work only under this license.
6.3 No sublicensing. You may not offer or impose terms on downstream recipients that alter or conflict with this license.

7. Eligibility Certification
7.1 Attestation. Before first Use and each year thereafter by the Reporting Deadline, You must make a written or electronic attestation that You are eligible under Section 4 and have complied with Sections 5.4, 5.5, and 5.6, and provide the Public Location URL of Your current Transparency Report. Nothing in this license requires public disclosure by individuals. The Licensor will provide an attestation template. Completing that template in good faith satisfies the form of this Section.

7.2 Evidence. Licensor may request reasonable documentation that substantiates Your attestation, such as a signed statement from a licensed accountant or attorney and summary ledgers showing total Net Assets, total Gross Receipts, and FTE Headcount calculations. You are not required to disclose full tax returns or individual pay records unless ordered by a court in a dispute under this license. If You fail to provide requested documentation within thirty days after written request, Your rights under this license terminate automatically at day thirty one.

7.3 Organization attestation. The attestation for a Benevolent Organization must state that on each Measurement Date: (1) FTE Headcount was calculated per this license and did not include Sham Employment; (2) the Organization’s Net Assets and Gross Receipts were below the Org Caps derived from that FTE Headcount; (3) all compensation was for Bona Fide Services and within Reasonable Compensation for the role; (4) any variable compensation funded by or materially informed by Use of the Software was made under a Compensation Plan in effect for the period and applied with Equitable Application; and (5) no distributions were made to investors or outside capital providers.

7.4 Failure to attest. If You fail to provide an attestation within thirty days of request, Your rights under this license terminate automatically at day thirty one.

7.5 Publication cure. If a Benevolent Organization fails to publish a Transparency Report by the Reporting Deadline, its rights under this license terminate automatically at day thirty one after the Reporting Deadline unless, within that thirty-day period, it publishes the Transparency Report and updates its attestation under Section 7.1. For the first Fiscal Year after the Organization’s first Use of the Software, the cure period in this Section is sixty days.

7.6 Good faith corrections. Minor errors or omissions in a Transparency Report that do not affect the Org Caps test or conceal compensation may be corrected within fourteen days after written notice without triggering termination.

8. Patents
8.1 Patent grant. If You are a contributor, You grant a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free patent license to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Software, limited to patent claims You can license that are necessarily infringed by Your contribution alone or by combination of Your contribution with the unmodified Software.
8.2 Patent retaliation. If You or Your Affiliate make a patent claim against any party alleging that the Software infringes a patent, Your license under this license terminates immediately.

9. Term and Termination
9.1 Term. This license is effective on receipt of the Software and lasts until terminated.
9.2 Automatic termination. Your rights terminate automatically if You breach Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
9.3 Cure. If You breach a curable obligation, Your license may be reinstated automatically if You cure the breach within thirty days of notice from Licensor.
9.4 Effect of termination. Upon termination, You must stop Using the Software and destroy copies in Your possession or control. Termination does not affect rights already granted to recipients of Your compliant distributions.

10. Compliance and Audit
10.1 Audit scope. Licensor may reasonably audit Your compliance with Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 on thirty days’ written notice. Audits may request the Compensation Plan, role descriptions, FTE Headcount calculations for the ninety-day lookback windows, and summary ledgers showing total compensation by role family and period. Individual pay records are not required unless ordered by a court or reasonably necessary to verify compliance with Sections 5.4 or 5.5 or the FTE Headcount calculation.
10.2 Confidentiality. Licensor must treat all nonpublic information received under this Section as confidential; use it solely to verify compliance; disclose it only to its counsel, independent auditors, or as required by law or court order; and upon request return or destroy it after the audit. Licensor may publish aggregated statistics that do not identify any Organization or individual.

11. Disclaimer of Warranty
The Software is provided “as is”. To the maximum extent allowed by law, Licensor disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, or statutory, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.

12. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent allowed by law, Licensor is not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, or for lost profits, trading losses, or loss of data, even if advised of the possibility. Licensor’s total liability for all claims relating to the Software is limited to one hundred United States dollars.

13. Export and Sanctions
You must comply with all applicable export control and sanctions laws. If any law prohibits Use by You, this license does not grant You any right to Use.

14. General
14.1 Entire agreement. This license is the entire agreement between You and Licensor about the Software.
14.2 Severability. If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect.
14.3 No waiver. A waiver must be in writing; one waiver is not a waiver of any other breach.
14.4 Governing law and venue. Unless the Licensor specifies otherwise in the NOTICE file, this license is governed by the law of the State of Oregon, USA, excluding its conflict-of-law rules, and exclusive venue lies in state or federal courts located in Multnomah County, Oregon. The Licensor may designate a different U.S. state law and venue in the NOTICE file for future disputes. A change of governing law or venue in the NOTICE file applies only to disputes arising from events after the date the change is first published.

15. Versioning
The Licensor may publish new versions of this license. Unless stated otherwise, You may choose to continue under this version or adopt a later version.

16. Auto-Update of Caps
The Wealth Caps and Org Caps update automatically as the underlying sources publish new values. If an updated source value is not available by June 30 of a given year, apply the prior value adjusted by the annual percentage change in CPI-U for the person’s or entity’s tax residence; if unavailable, use U.S. CPI-U.
