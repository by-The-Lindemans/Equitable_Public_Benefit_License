# Adopter Guide - PBE-L v1.0

1) Copy `LICENSE.txt` into your repository root unchanged.  
2) Keep `attestation/ATT_ORG.md` and `attestation/ATT_INDIVIDUAL.md` as templates only. Do not commit completed forms.  
3) Each year, complete the appropriate template and email it to **attest@lndmn.com**.  
   - You may link to existing public filings such as Form 990 instead of duplicating content.  
4) Compute your eligibility caps each year:
   - FTE Headcount = total paid hours over the last 90 days ÷ 40 (round to the nearest tenth)
   - Org Net Assets Cap = 2 x FTE Headcount x Net Worth Cap
   - Org Gross Receipts Cap = 2 x FTE Headcount x Income Cap
   - Wealth Caps: use the sources defined in the license; update when the sources update
5) Add the single License badge from **[BADGE.md](./BADGE.md)** at the top of your README.  
6) Do not use a “compliant” badge; compliance is shown by filing your Attestation by email.  

## Annual checklist
- Recompute FTE and Org Caps; update Attestation answers; email the Attestation to **attest@lndmn.com** by the Reporting Deadline.  
- Verify your README still shows the License badge from BADGE.md.
