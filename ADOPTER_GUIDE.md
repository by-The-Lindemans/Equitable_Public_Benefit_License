# Adopter Guide - PBE-L v1.0

1) Copy `LICENSE.txt` unchanged into your repository root.
2) Create `NOTICE` with:
   - Your transparency URL
   - Your compliance contact email
   - Optional venue override if you will not use Oregon
3) Publish transparency by the Reporting Deadline using `transparency/SCHEMA.csv` for the tabular items; PDF is fine for the rest.
4) Have an officer sign the annual attestation in `/attestation`.
5) Add this badge linking to your Transparency Report:

[![PBE-L compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/PBE--L-compliant-brightgreen)](https://example.org/your-transparency-url)

Notes
- Do not modify `LICENSE.txt`. If you need different terms, contact the licensor for a separate license.
- Your project may keep the `NOTICE` file private if the transparency URL is already public on your site.
