# Adopter Guide - PBE-L v1.0

This guide is the authoritative instructions for adopting PBE-L. The README links here to avoid duplication.

## For repository maintainers
1) Copy `LICENSE.txt` into your repository root unchanged.  
2) Keep `attestation/ATT_ORG.md` and `attestation/ATT_INDIVIDUAL.md` as templates only; do not commit completed forms.  
3) Add the single License badge from **[BADGE.md](./BADGE.md)** at the top of your README.  
4) Point users to the “For users” section below; maintainers do not collect or store attestations.

## For users of PBE-L software (Licensees)
1) Compute your eligibility caps each year:  
   - FTE Headcount = total paid hours over the last 90 days ÷ 40 (round to the nearest tenth)  
   - Org Net Assets Cap = 2 x FTE Headcount x Net Worth Cap  
   - Org Gross Receipts Cap = 2 x FTE Headcount x Income Cap  
   - Wealth Caps: use the sources defined in the license; update when those sources update  
2) Complete the appropriate Attestation template (organizations use `ATT_ORG.md`; individuals use `ATT_INDIVIDUAL.md`).  
   - You may link to existing public filings (for example, Form 990) instead of duplicating content.  
   - Subject: `PBE-L Attestation - <Org or Individual Name> - <Transparency Year>`  
   - Attach as PDF or Markdown. Name files like `PBEL-Attestation-OrgName-2025.pdf`.  
3) Email the Attestation to **attest@lndmn.com** by the Reporting Deadline in the license.

## Reporting Deadline
File by the earlier of:  
- 120 days after fiscal year end; or  
- the deadline for your largest mandatory annual public filing in your home jurisdiction.  
See Section 6 of the license.

## Annual checklist
- Recompute FTE and Org Caps; update Attestation answers.  
- Email the Attestation to **attest@lndmn.com** by the Reporting Deadline.  
- Retain the filed Attestation and supporting materials for 7 years.  
- Maintainers: verify the README still shows the License badge from BADGE.md.

## Privacy and redaction
Do not include account numbers or sensitive personal data. Redact where needed, but keep figures and sources verifiable.
