# Trademarks

“Public Benefit Equity License”, “PBE-L”, and the PBE-L badge are marks of by the Lindemans LLC.

You may use the names and badge to accurately refer to the unmodified license and to indicate your project has adopted it. Do not use the marks in a way that suggests a modified or different license is PBE-L. Do not use the marks as part of your own license name.

We may update this page to clarify proper use.
