Scope: errata and clarifications only. Examples: typos; broken links; internal cross-references; glossary alignment; format fixes.

Out of scope: policy changes; feature requests; threshold changes; carve-outs.

How to propose an erratum
1. Open an issue using the “Erratum” template. Cite section and sentence.
2. Propose exact replacement text limited to the smallest change that fixes the issue.
3. Submit a PR referencing the issue. PRs must modify only the minimal text required.

Release cadence
- Accepted errata are batched in patch releases (v1.0.x).
- Substantive changes, if any, would ship only in a major version (v2.0.0) and follow a public RFC process announced in this repo.
