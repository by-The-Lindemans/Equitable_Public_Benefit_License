# Public Benefit Equity License v1.0 - reference repo

This repository publishes the canonical text of PBE-L and a small compliance kit for adopters. PBE-L keeps overhead low for good-faith nonprofits and co-ops while preventing capture by for-profit and ultra-wealthy actors.

## Files
- `LICENSE.txt` — the full legal text
- `attestation/` — fill-in templates for the annual Attestation; users complete and email to attest@lndmn.com
- `BADGE.md` — the canonical PBE-L badge snippet

## Getting started (for repository maintainers)
1) Copy `LICENSE.txt` unchanged to the repo root.
2) Keep both templates in `attestation/`; do not commit completed attestations.
3) Add the single License badge from `BADGE.md` to your README.

## Using this software (for users of a PBE-L project)
Each year, complete the appropriate Attestation (organizations use `ATT_ORG.md`; individuals use `ATT_INDIVIDUAL.md`) and email it to **attest@lndmn.com** by the Reporting Deadline in the license.

Details live here: see [Adopter Guide](./ADOPTER_GUIDE.md) for the Reporting Deadline, what to include, and annual checklists.

## Changes and corrections
- We accept errata; we track them in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Policy proposals are not in scope for this repo. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the process.

## Versioning
- We tag the license and kit with semver. Legal changes bump the major version. Documentation or schema clarifications bump the minor or patch version.
