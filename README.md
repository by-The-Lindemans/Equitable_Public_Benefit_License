# Public Benefit Equity License v1.0 — reference repo

This repository publishes the canonical text of PBE-L and a small compliance kit for adopters. PBE-L keeps overhead low for good-faith nonprofits and co-ops while preventing capture by for-profit and ultra-wealthy actors.

## Files
- `LICENSE.txt` — the full legal text
- `attestation/` — the single compliance file templates; copy one and keep it current each year
- `BADGE.md` — canonical badge snippets; copy from here into your READMEs

**Getting started:** see **[Adopter Guide](./ADOPTER_GUIDE.md)** for step-by-step instructions, badge setup, and examples.

## Changes and corrections
- We accept errata; we track them in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Policy proposals are not in scope for this repo. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the process.

## Versioning
- We tag the license and kit with semver. Legal changes bump the major version. Documentation or schema clarifications bump the minor or patch version.
