# Public Benefit Equity License v1.0 - reference repo

This repository publishes the canonical text of PBE-L and a small compliance kit for adopters. PBE-L keeps overhead low for good-faith nonprofits and co-ops while preventing capture by for-profit and ultra-wealthy actors.

## Files
[LICENSE.txt](./LICENSE.txt): the full legal text

[attestation/](./attestation/): fill-in templates for the annual Attestation; users complete and email to attest@lndmn.com

[BADGE.md](./BADGE.md): the canonical PBE-L badge snippet

## Getting started (for repository maintainers)
1) Copy [LICENSE.txt](./LICENSE.txt) unchanged to the repo root.
2) Keep both templates in [attestation/](./attestation/); do not commit completed attestations.
3) Add the License badge from [BADGE.md](./BADGE.md) to your [README.md](./README.md).

## Using this software (for users of a PBE-L project)
Each year, each user must complete the appropriate Attestation ([ATT_ORG.md](./attestation/ATT_ORG.md) or [ATT_INDIVIDUAL.md](./attestation/ATT_INDIVIDUAL.md)) and email it to attest@lndmn.com by the Reporting Deadline in the [license](./LICENSE.txt).

See [Adopter Guide](./ADOPTER_GUIDE.md) for the Reporting Deadline, what to include, and annual checklists.

## Changes and corrections
- We accept errata; we track them in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Versioning
- We tag the license and kit with semver. Legal changes bump the major version. Documentation or schema clarifications bump the minor or patch version.
